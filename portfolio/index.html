                    <p id="bio">Wilson earned a decree in computer science and business administration years ago, but
                        has
                        never stopped his professional or personal education. He is a perpetual learner who relishes
                        studying everything from calculus to cello to Italian, and thrives on sharing his knowledge
                        with others. Generous with his time and his experience, Wilson has always enjoyed tutoring
                        fellow classmates whether in math, language, music or sports. He is as comfortable picking

                        flexible to respond to that need are some of Wilsonâ€™s strengths, in addition to his sensitivity
                        and openness to learn about others. Though he enjoys studying a broad range of subjects
                        and activities, when he is working on something he strives to deliver exactly what his
                        audience craves, whether it is a nimble app, a delicious Boston cream pie, or an evocative</p>
